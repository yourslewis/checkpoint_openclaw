[Sat 2026-02-21 16:10 PST] Is everything going smoothly?
assistant: Yes—ready to proceed. I found likely candidates, but I want to confirm the exact paper you mean by **“Ultra HSTU”** before downloading:

Possible match:
- **“Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion‑Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations”** (Meta, arXiv 2402.17152)

Is this the one?  
If not, please paste the exact title or URL. Once confirmed, I’ll run the full **paper‑review** skill (download → summarize → compile/render → PR).

[Sat 2026-02-21 16:11 PST] No, not this one, it is called ultra HSTU, the latest one from 2026. You need to search for it
assistant: Found it. Likely match is:

**“Bending the Scaling Law Curve in Large‑Scale Recommendation Systems”** (arXiv 2602.16986, published 3 days ago) — it explicitly mentions **ULTRA‑HSTU** in the abstract.  
Link: https://arxiv.org/html/2602.16986

Confirm this is the correct “Ultra HSTU” paper?  
If yes, I’ll download the PDF and run the full paper‑review workflow.

[Sat 2026-02-21 16:13 PST] Confirm, let's review it
assistant: Great — starting the paper-review pipeline.

Please approve exec id **14019e90** to:
- download the PDF
- extract text
- set up the folder `papers/meta_ultra_hstu/`

Once that’s done, I’ll draft the LaTeX summary (with quotes), compile/render, and open a PR.
