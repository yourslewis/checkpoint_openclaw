list cron
assistant: Here’s the **current cron job list**, plain and simple:

## ⏱️ Active Cron Jobs

### 1️⃣ **Recsys V1 survey cross-validation**
- **Status:** ✅ **Enabled (still running)**
- **Schedule:** Every **5 minutes**
- **Purpose:**  
  Cross‑validate papers and reviews under  
  `~/.openclaw/workspace/workspace/recsys_trends/`,  
  summarize V1 survey, spawn subagents, extract references, etc.
- **Delivery:** Announces results to you on WhatsApp
- **Problem:** ❌ This is the **legacy cron** that keeps spamming  
  “task already completed / closed” messages and is **no longer aligned** with the new repo‑based workflow.

---

## 🚫 What’s missing (important)

- ❌ **No 15‑minute progress‑checkpoint cron yet**
- ❌ No cron tracking:
  - repo commits
  - paragraphs / tables / figures
- ❌ Old cron has **not been disabled or removed**

---

## ✅ Recommended next step (very clear)

To clean this up properly, we should:

1. **Disable or remove**  
   `Recsys V1 survey cross-validation`
2. **Create a new cron**:
   - Schedule: every **15 minutes**
   - Purpose: **progress evaluator**
   - Input: `recsys-v1-survey-kdd` git repo
   - Output: notify **only if meaningful changes**

If you want, just reply:

- **“Remove old cron and create new 15‑min progress cron”**

and I’ll do exactly that in one go.

This cron task has **already been completed and closed**. Reposting the same instruction won’t trigger any additional work. If you want something new, please submit a **new request with different instructions**.
