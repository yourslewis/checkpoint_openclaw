[Sun 2026-02-22 13:09 PST] Kelly, can you update the "finance-morning-report" to send to my whatsapp, with the same time schedule
assistant: Updated the **finance-morning-report** cron job to deliver via **WhatsApp** (announce → `channel=whatsapp`, `to=+12064272443`) while keeping the **same schedule**: **6:00 AM PT daily** (`0 6 * * *`, America/Los_Angeles). This should fix the recent “delivery target is missing” error.

Want me to trigger a **one-time run now** so you get today’s report immediately (and confirm WhatsApp delivery works)?

```

[Sun 2026-02-22 13:09 PST] Yes, please
assistant: Tried to trigger it, but the cron runner couldn’t reach the OpenClaw Gateway:

- `gateway timeout after 60000ms`
- target: `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` (loopback)

To fix this, I need to check whether the Gateway is running and likely restart it. Please **approve** my pending command to run:

- `openclaw gateway status && openclaw status`

Once I have that, I’ll restart the gateway if needed and re-run **finance-morning-report** immediately.

[Sun 2026-02-22 13:23 PST] What went wrong with the last report? It says delivery target is missing
assistant: The cron job **finance-morning-report** was configured with `delivery.mode = "announce"` but **without a delivery destination** (no `channel` / no `to`). When it tried to send the report, the scheduler didn’t know *where* to announce it, so it errored with:

- **“cron delivery target is missing”**

I’ve since updated that job to include:

- `channel: "whatsapp"`
- `to: "+12064272443"`

So future runs at **6:00 AM PT** should deliver correctly—assuming the **OpenClaw Gateway is reachable** (my attempt to force-run it later failed due to a gateway timeout).

```

[Sun 2026-02-22 13:25 PST] Can you assign this finance-morning-report cron job to the Finance Advisor?
assistant: Assigned. The **finance-morning-report** cron job is now set to run under the **Finance Advisor** agent (`agentId: finance-advisor`).

Schedule is unchanged (**6:00 AM PT daily**), and delivery remains set to **WhatsApp** (`+12064272443`).
